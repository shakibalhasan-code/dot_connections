└── main.dart                # Application entry point
```

### State Management
The app uses **GetX** for state management. Controllers handle business logic:

```dart
class ExampleController extends GetxController {
  final _data = <String>[].obs;
  List<String> get data => _data;
  
  void addData(String item) {
    _data.add(item);
  }
}
```

### Adding New Screens
1. Create controller in `app/controllers/`
2. Create screen in `app/views/screens/`
3. Add route in `app/core/utils/app_routes.dart`
4. Register dependencies in `app/app_bindings.dart`

### API Integration
Replace mock services with real API calls:

```dart
class ApiService extends GetConnect {
  @override
  void onInit() {
    httpClient.baseUrl = AppConfig.apiBaseUrl;
    httpClient.defaultContentType = 'application/json';
  }
  
  Future<User> getUser(String id) async {
    final response = await get('/users/$id');
    return User.fromJson(response.body);
  }
}
```
