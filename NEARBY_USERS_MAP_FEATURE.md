# Nearby Users Map Feature Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a complete nearby users map feature for your Flutter dot_connections app. This feature fetches nearby users from the API endpoint `/user/nearby?radius=100` and displays them on a Google Maps interface with connections shown as polylines.

## What I've Built

### 1. **NearbyUser Data Model** (`lib/app/data/models/nearby_user_model.dart`)

- Complete model classes for the API response:
  - `NearbyUser`: Main user model with all properties from API
  - `LocationModel`: User location coordinates
  - `NearbyUsersResponse`: API response wrapper

### 2. **API Client** (`lib/app/data/api/nearby_users_api_client.dart`)

- `MatchApiClient` class with methods:
  - `getNearbyUsers(radius: 100)`: Fetches users within specified radius
  - `getNearbyUsersWithParams()`: Advanced filtering with custom parameters

### 3. **Enhanced Map Services** (`lib/app/core/services/map_services.dart`)

- Location permission handling
- Current location detection using `geolocator`
- User marker creation with different colors for connected/non-connected users
- **Polyline generation for connected users** (smooth lines between your location and connected users)
- Camera positioning and bounds calculation

### 4. **Updated Map Screen** (`lib/app/views/screens/parent/map/map_screen.dart`)

- Modern Google Maps implementation replacing the old OpenStreetMap
- **Search bar at the top** (matching your screenshot design)
- Settings button for map controls
- Real-time loading states
- Connected users info panel at the bottom
- Floating action button for "My Location"

### 5. **Map Controller** (`lib/app/controllers/map_screen_contorller.dart`)

- Complete state management for:
  - Current location tracking
  - Nearby users data
  - Map markers and polylines
  - Loading states
  - User interactions (refresh, location centering)

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ **API Integration**

- Hits the exact API endpoint: `{{url}}/user/nearby?radius=100`
- Parses the complete JSON response structure you provided
- Handles authentication via existing API service

### ✅ **Map Visualization**

- Google Maps with satellite/normal view options
- Current location marker (red pin for "You")
- User markers (green for connected, blue for non-connected users)
- **Smooth polylines connecting you to users where `isConnected: true`**

### ✅ **User Experience**

- Search location bar (matching your design)
- Settings menu with map controls
- Connected users counter and list
- Refresh functionality
- Loading states and error handling
- Permission requests for location access

### ✅ **Platform Setup**

- Added required dependencies: `geolocator`, `permission_handler`
- Android location permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- iOS location permissions in `Info.plist`

## How It Works

1. **App Launch**: Map screen loads and requests location permission
2. **Location Detection**: Gets user's current location using GPS
3. **API Call**: Fetches nearby users from your server endpoint
4. **Map Display**:
   - Shows all users as markers
   - Your location as red marker
   - Connected users have green markers
   - **Polylines draw from your location to each connected user**
5. **Interactions**: Users can refresh, search locations, and view user details

## Polylines Implementation

The polylines feature specifically addresses your requirement:

```dart
// Creates smooth polylines for users where isConnected: true
Set<Polyline> createPolylines(Position currentLocation, List<NearbyUser> connectedUsers) {
  // Filters only connected users
  final connected = connectedUsers.where((user) => user.isConnected).toList();
  
  // Creates green dashed lines from current location to each connected user
  // Lines are smooth, geodesic, and visually appealing
}
```

## Usage

The map screen is now ready to use! Just navigate to the map tab and the system will:

1. Request location permissions
2. Get your current location
3. Fetch nearby users from your API
4. Display everything on the map with polylines for connections

The implementation matches the screenshot you provided and includes all the requested functionality for showing nearby users and polylines for connected users.
